# Hi there 👋

## About me


🕹️ Together with a few friends, I made a game! https://github.com/gadse/high-moon and https://gadse.itch.io/high-moon

🌱 I’m currently learning
  - C# for fun and wörk (see https://github.com/gadse/dungeon-explorer)
  - C++ for utility purposes (see https://gitlab.com/gadse/systemstats-cpp)
  - Angular for loads of fun (see https://github.com/gadse/fckry)

💬 Ask me about Python, Heavy Metal, Software Engineering, or Role-Playing Games.
  
🤔 I’m looking for help with cross-compiling Rust via GitLab-CI/Docker (https://gitlab.com/gadse/systemstats/-/pipelines/122136818)

😄 Pronouns: Just pick some that you like, as long as I recognize that you mean _me_.
